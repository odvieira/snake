Snake Game made by Daniel Vieira(github.com/odvieira) and Lucas S. Takahashi(gitlab.com/lucasshoiti)

### How do I get set up? ###

Using Make on a terminal opened inside the game's folder, you can install and remove the game easily.
Commands: (an desktop shortcut could be created by default, but the gnome-terminal is necessary)
##
		$ make 	//Build the project, after that, by inserting line
		$./snakeGame //you should be good to go
##
		$ make run  //build and execute;
##
		$ make clean //unmount the project;
##
		$ make purge //delete all files from the project
