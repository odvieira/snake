### What is this repository for? ###

This is a snake game writed in C, there are some resources of the Ncurses library in the source code, which makes it a
dependency, so, if wanna play it, you must run in a unix machine with Ncurses installed.

This project is an academic activity made with by two beginners, so it could not be the optimal program but it's really fun
and works without known bugs. Have fun.
